## Description

BookmarkD is an app That was created in order for its users to be able to take notes on any topic of their choosing and organize these notes seperately. As A User, I will initially be taken to a page with an option to login or signup. Once logged into my account, I can see my list of All of the notes that I've added shown as an Icon. Users can also access each individual note that is in their library on a seperate page. 

Each Note in a users library can be edited & updated. There will also be an option to add new notes as well as delete current ones.
